# business-website-counter
## My Idea

At the start of this project, I thought the API would track any website daily views if the url was input.  That wasn't the case.  I learned that it's used to track your own website views.  To make it interesting I created to text inputs and turned it into a battle of website views.  The way it works is every time I enter it, it adds 1 to the view count.  Other website's that I use regularly already had higher views (google.com, github.etc).
