# business-website-counter
## My Idea

At the start of this project, I thought the API would track any website daily views if the url was input.  That wasn't the case.  I learned that it's used to track your own website views.  To make it interesting I created to text inputs and turned it into a battle of website views.  The way it works is every time I enter it, it adds 1 to the view count.  Other website's that I use regularly already had higher views (google.com, github.etc).  

I started off with functionality and then eventually styled it all.  My first task was setting up two input boxes with a button that had an event listener add to it.  The event listener then invoked the functions necessary for the additional features.

## Next Feature - URL view count and Logo API
After getting my input to get the correct data, I created divs that updates the text of the view count that was returned from invoking a function that used a get method.  I also found a cool little API that retried the logo from the company of the url input into the text boxes.
